### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I hope you haven't made a mistake and didn't intend to go to Pornhub because GitHub is better. Trust me, on GitHub, you can learn everything you need to know for survival in the future. In the future, where secret things like the ones you saw in movies like "I, Robot" or "Terminator" will rule, you will have great value thanks to the information and knowledge you have in your head. Thanks to immersing yourself in the secrets and intricacies of GitHub.   
Anyway, I'm here to become a web developer/frontend developer. That's my dream. Here on my profile, you'll find repositories, interesting ideas that I've brought to life in code. I'm trying to make the code work. I'm learning to understand logic and context, programming principles. Here's the history of my learning and growth. In 2020, I started learning this art while working, but sadly, I have to tell you that I gave up back then. So I have the basics, I understand what I'm doing, which is why it's a bit faster for me now in the beginning because I already know something. Now I'm learning more things through Udemy courses, my own experiments, which you'll find here. And most importantly, I have to admit, this brought me back, and this time I won't give up. I even quit my job, and I'm fully committed to this, ChatGPT. Yes, artificial intelligence convinced me that now is the time because I see extreme potential in it for my needs. Having ChatGPT in 2020, I wouldn't give up. I do everything with it, ask it everything, rely on it, and it genuinely helps me, motivates me, and facilitates my journey.   
Now, on a practical note, the pinned repositories are the ones I'm currently working on or have completed. The rest are on the waiting list, which I hope to tackle soon. So that's about it.  

Wish me all the best.  

Thanks.
