### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Hello, I hope you haven't made mistake and didn't intend to go on Pornhub because GitHub is better. Trust me, on GitHub, you can learn everything you need to know for survival in the future. In the future, where secret things like the ones you saw in movies like "I, Robot", "Terminator" or "Chappie" will rule, you will have great value thanks to the information and knowledge you have in your head. Thanks to immersing yourself in the secrets and intricacies of GitHub.   
Anyway, I'm here to become a frontend/web developer, or anything what caught my interest. That's my dream. Here on my profile, you'll find repositories, interesting ideas that I've brought to life through code. I'm trying to make the code work. I'm learning to understand logic and context of coding, programming fundamentals and so on. Here's the history of my learning and growth. In 2020, I started learning this art while working, but sadly, I have to tell you that I gave up back then. So I have the absolut basics from that period, I understand what I'm doing a little bit, which is why it's a bit faster for me now in the beginning because I already know something/nothing. Now I'm learning more things through my own experiments, which you'll find here, Udemy courses, courses on Linkedin Learning, freecodecamp courses, many interesting articles, blogs from senior developers and so on. And most importantly, I have to admit, this brought me back, and this time I won't give up. I even quit my job, and I'm fully committed to this, ChatGPT. Yes, artificial intelligence convinced me that now is the time, because I see extreme potential in it for my needs. Having ChatGPT in 2020, I wouldn't give up. At the beginning, I did mostly everything with her, but now, after 5+ months, I rely more on googling stuff, however, sometimes when I need to explain something simple/difficult or new, I still do it with her.  

Wish me all the best.  

Thanks.  

ðŸŒ± And what I've learned and know so far: HTML5 and CSS3 are my comfort zone. I'm also well-acquainted with GIT, I use him everyday. Javascript is another area of familiarity, it's my first/prefered language. I've been learning it through Udemy courses, freecodecamp's courses, Skillema courses, Linkedin Learning, so many materials on web like blogs and so on. I believe I have a grasp of the fundamentals but I'm eagerly looking forward to delving deeper into details like ES6 features, recursions, spread operator,... Now, I'm primarily learning React and things related to it, like React Router and the structure and logic of working with React on SPAs. I've already done some projects, but what I'm looking forward to the most is when I finish a map of places where I've slept, whether it's in a car, in a sleeping bag, or in a tent... SQL has also caught my interest, I know basic and I have done one mini project as part of my job application with it.
And what is on my list to learn next? Node.js is must-know technology, more about databases with mySQL and NEXT.js is highly recommended to know nowdays. And for what I want to learn it? My next big project will be for beginning simple CMS, but with a lot possible features to add.
